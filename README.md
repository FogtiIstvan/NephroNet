##Description:
This project is based on the "CT KIDNEY DATASET: Normal-Cyst-Tumor and Stone" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone)

The data was collected from different hospitals, where patients were already diagnosed with having a kidney tumor, cyst, normal or stone findings.
Both the Coronal and Axial cuts were selected from both contrast and non-contrast studies with protocol for the whole abdomen and urogram. 
Our goal is to build a model that, after training and optimization, classifies CT images with high accuracy.

##Files:
The file NephroNet.ipynb is responsible for fetching the dataset, separeting them in to train, test, validation inputs and outputs
